wikiquiz
========

WikiQuiz attempts to form quizzes from an arbitrary Wikipedia article. It analyzes each page, and produces a variable number of questions for each page based on the material that is present on the page. 

WikiQuiz is currently most optimized for historical figures / places, and thus the questions produced for items in those topics are of much higher quality.
